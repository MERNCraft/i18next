<!-- [Tutorial](https://MERNCraft.github.io/i18next) -->

A demonstration of how to use [i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) to translate the text of a web site, using `translation.json` files stored in the `public/locales/` folder.

The original translations are stored, phrase by phrase, in `data/allTranslations.json`. You can easily edit this file and update the translation files in the `public/locales/` folder by running...
```
node data/createTranslationJSONFiles.js
